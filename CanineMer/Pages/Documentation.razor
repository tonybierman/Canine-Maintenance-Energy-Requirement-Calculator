        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The Maintenance Energy Requirement (MER) Calculator is a tool designed to estimate the daily energy needs of dogs. This calculation is based on the Resting Energy Requirement (RER) formula, which is then adjusted to account for the dog's specific life stage, activity level, and physiological status.</p>

        <h2>Formula</h2>
        <p>The core formula used in this calculator is:</p>
        <p><code>√√ (BW kg × BW kg × BW kg) × 70 = RER</code></p>

        <h2>Purpose of the Calculator</h2>
        <p>The purpose of the MER Calculator is to provide dog owners, breeders, and veterinarians with an estimate of a dog's daily energy needs. Accurate estimation of MER is crucial for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Nutrition Planning: Tailoring a dog's diet to meet its specific energy needs.</li>
            <li>Weight Management: Helping maintain optimal body weight, prevent obesity, or support weight loss.</li>
            <li>Health and Welfare: Ensuring dogs receive adequate energy for growth, healing, and overall health.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Usage</h2>
        <p>To use the calculator, input the dog's body weight in pounds. The tool will first calculate the RER and then adjust this value based on the dog's life stage and other relevant factors to estimate the MER.</p>

        <h2>Life Stages and Factors</h2>
        <p>The calculator adjusts the RER based on various life stages and factors, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Active Working Dog: 2.0–5.0 (Wide range for high activity)</li>
            <li>Gestation: 1.6–2.0 (Increased for pregnancy)</li>
            <li>Inactive Obese Prone: 1.2–1.4 (Reduced for obesity management)</li>
            <li>Intact Adult: 1.4–1.6 (Slightly low for intact, but combined for simplicity)</li>
            <li>Lactation: 2.0–5.0 (High for milk production)</li>
            <li>Neutered Adult: 1.4–1.6 (Typical for neutered adults)</li>
            <li>Puppy 0 to 4 Months: 3.0 (High for early growth)</li>
            <li>Puppy 4 Months to Adult: 1.5–2.0 (Transition to adult needs)</li>
            <li>Weight Gain: 1.2–1.8 (Increased for growth)</li>
            <li>Weight Loss: 1.0 (Restricted for weight loss)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each life stage or condition has specific multipliers applied to the RER to estimate the MER accurately.</p>

        <h2>Digestibility</h2>
        <p>Digestibility refers to the proportion of nutrients in a dog's food that are absorbed by its body, directly affecting the actual energy available from the diet. The MER Calculator assumes an average digestibility for typical commercial dog foods (around 80-90%). However, this can vary significantly based on food quality:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>High-Quality Diets</strong>: Premium or veterinary diets often have digestibility rates above 90%, meaning more energy is absorbed per cup, potentially reducing the required feeding amount.</li>
            <li><strong>Low-Quality Diets</strong>: Foods with lower digestibility (e.g., below 80%) may provide less usable energy, requiring larger portions to meet the MER.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For precise feeding recommendations, consider the digestibility of your dog's food when interpreting the calculator's output. If the kcal per cup is provided, the calculator estimates cups to feed based on the MER, but adjustments may be needed if digestibility deviates significantly from the average. Consult your veterinarian or the food manufacturer for specific digestibility data.</p>
