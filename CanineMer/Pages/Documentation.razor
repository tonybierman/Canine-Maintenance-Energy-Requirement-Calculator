        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The Maintenance Energy Requirement (MER) Calculator is a tool designed to estimate the daily energy needs of dogs. This calculation is based on the Resting Energy Requirement (RER) formula, which is then adjusted to account for the dog's specific life stage, activity level, and physiological status.</p>

        <h2>Formula</h2>
        <p>The core formula used in this calculator is:</p>
        <p><code>√√ (BW kg × BW kg × BW kg) × 70 = RER</code></p>

        <h2>Purpose of the Calculator</h2>
        <p>The purpose of the MER Calculator is to provide dog owners, breeders, and veterinarians with an estimate of a dog's daily energy needs. Accurate estimation of MER is crucial for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Nutrition Planning: Tailoring a dog's diet to meet its specific energy needs.</li>
            <li>Weight Management: Helping maintain optimal body weight, prevent obesity, or support weight loss.</li>
            <li>Health and Welfare: Ensuring dogs receive adequate energy for growth, healing, and overall health.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Usage</h2>
        <p>To use the calculator, input the dog's body weight in pounds. The tool will first calculate the RER and then adjust this value based on the dog's life stage and other relevant factors to estimate the MER.</p>

        <h2>Life Stages and Factors</h2>
        <p>The calculator adjusts the RER based on various life stages and factors, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Neutered Adult</li>
            <li>Active/Working Dogs</li>
            <li>Puppies (age-specific adjustments)</li>
            <li>Pregnant or Lactating Females</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each life stage or condition has specific multipliers applied to the RER to estimate the MER accurately.</p>
